HOW TO USE HELP                                       *mydoc-how-to-use-help*

The most import thing to learn about in vim is...

>
  :help
<
and

>
  :help command
<

TAB    - cycles through possible command completions
CTRL-d - lists possible command completions

Also, when in the help pages, CTRL-] jumps to subjects between bars
and CTRL-T jumps back


=============================================================================
MUST HAVE HELP                                         *mydoc-muse-have-help*

:help cmdline-special        Ex special characters
:help ins-completion         Insert mode completion
:help complete-functions     functions for finding completions

Do :help i_ CTRL-d for insert commands, v_ for visual, etc.


=============================================================================
ENTER INSERT MODE                                   *mydoc-enter-insert-mode*

  |i|   - Insert before character under cursor
  |a|   - Insert after cursor
  |I|   - Insert at beginning of current line
  |A|   - Insert at end of the line
  |o|   - Starts insert mode in a new line below current one
  |O|   - Insert in a new line above current one

For more information, see :help change.txt.

Special keys:~

See: |ins-special-keys|

Special special keys:~

CTRL-O          execute one command, return to Insert mode
CTRL-\ CTRL-O   like CTRL-O but don't move the cursor
CTRL-L          when 'insertmode' is set: go to Normal mode
CTRL-A          Insert previously inserted text.
CTRL-W          Delete the word before the cursor.
CTRL-U          Delete all entered characters in the current line.

See: |ins-special-special|


=============================================================================
MOTION                                                         *mydoc-motion*

  →  |  ←  |  description
  ---+-----+-------------------------------------
  /  |  ?  |  Search for a pattern of text, jump to it by hitting Enter (<CR>)
  *  |  #  |  Search for the word under cursor
  n  |  N  |  Jump to the next match for the previous search
  $  |  ^  |  Position cursor at end of current line
  f  |  F  |  Position cursor on the character in the same line that matches
     |     |  the next keystroke
  t  |  T  |  Position cursor before the next character that matches the keystroke
  ;  |  ,  |  Repeat the last f, F, t, or T
  w  |  b  |  Move to start of next word
  W  |  B  |  Move to start of next "WORD" (sequence of non-blank characters)
  }  |  {  |  Move down one paragraph (block of text separated by blank lines)
  gg |     |  Jump to first line of document
  G  |     |  Jump to end of document


Pro tip: while in insert mode, <C-w> deletes the last word before cursor.
         This is more efficient than backspacing.

For in-depth documentation on motions, see :help motion.txt.

Jump history:~

Some of the above motions jump, and it is very useful to know how to backtrack
those jumps. From the :help jump-motions documentation:
>
  A "jump" is one of the following commands:
  ', `, G, /, ?, n, N, %, (, ), [[, ]], {, }, :s, :tag, L, M, H and the
  commands that start editing a new file. If you make the cursor "jump"
  with one of these commands, the position of the cursor before the
  jump is remembered.
<

  '. or  `. - Motion brings the cursor back on the exact place where the last
              change was made
  '' or  `` - Jump back to before the previous jump with
  <C-o>     - jump backwards in history
  <C-i>     - jump forwards in history

Bindings:~

  ,x - Switch between the currently open buffer and the previous one

Text object motions:~

( - sentences backward.  |exclusive| motion.
) - sentences forward.  |exclusive| motion.
{ - paragraphs backward.  |exclusive| motion.
} - paragraphs forward.  |exclusive| motion.
]]- sections forward or to the next '{' in the first column.
[[- sections backward or to the previous '{' in the first column.

LERN TO SPEAK VIM                                             *mydoc-speakvim*

... - verbs, nouns and modifiers

Using vim is like talking to your editor in 'verb modifier object' sentences

  Verbs:~
    |v| (visual)
    |c| (change)
    |d| (delete)
    |y| (yank/copy)
  Objects:~
    |w| (word)
    |s| (sentence)
    |p| (paragraph)
    |b| (block/parentheses)
    |a| (arguments) - plugin
    |c| (column) - textobj-word-column plugin
      ac - "a column", a column based on "a word" |aw|.
      ic - "inner column", a column based on the "inner word" |iw|.
      aC - "a COLUMN", a column based on "a WORD" |aW|.
      iC - "inner COLUMN", a column based on "inner WORD" |iW|.
      More: |textobj--word-column-examples|
  Modifiers:~
    |i| (inside), a (around)
    |t| (till..finds a character)
    |/| (search..find a string/regex)

Speak to the editor in sentences:~

  Delete the current word:                     |diw|   (delete inside word)
  Change current sentence:                     |cis|   (change inside sentence)
  Change a string inside quotes:               ci"   (change inside quote)
  Change until next occurrence of 'foo':       |c/foo| (change search foo)
  Change everything from here to the letter X: |ctX|
  Visually select this paragraph:              |vap|  (visual around paragraph)


=============================================================================
HOLDING DOWN J IS A VIM ANTI-PATTERN                      *mydoc-holdingdownj*

  -          - lines upward, on the first non-blank character |linewise|.
  +          - lines downward, on the first non-blank character |linewise|.
   or CTRL-M
   or <CR>
  |nG|         - jump to line n ("line 5, Go")
  <C-o>      - jump backwards ("out")
  <C-i>      - jump forwards ("in")
  |L|          - jump to bottom of screen ("low")
  |M|          - jump to middle of screen ("middle")
  |H|          - jump to top of screen ("high")
  |zt|         - put this line at the 't'op of the screen
  |zb|         - put this line at the 'b'ottom of the screen
  |zz|         - put this line at the middle of the screen
  <c-f>`     - (forward) moves down 1 page-length.
  <c-b>`     - (back) moves up 1 page-length.
  <c-d>`     - (down) moves down 1/2 page-length.
  <c-u>`     - (up) moves up 1/2 page-length.
  |{|          - Move to start of previous paragraph or code block.
  |}|          - Move to end of next paragraph or code block.
  |/|{search}  - Search forward
  |?|{search}  - Search backward
  |t|{char}    - Move forward until the next occurrence of the character.
  |f|{char}    - Move forward over the next occurrence of the character.
  |T|{char}    - Move backward until the previous occurrence of the character.
  |F|{char}    - Move backward over the previous occurrence of the character.

  Moving wordwise with |w|, |W|, |b|, |B|, |e|, and |E| is better, too.


=============================================================================
SEARCH                                                         *mydoc-search*

For basic searching:

  /pattern        - search forward for pattern
  ?pattern        - search backward
  n               - repeat forward search
  N               - repeat backward

More cool searching tricks:

  *               - search for word currently under cursor
  g*              - search for partial word under cursor
                    (repeat with n)
  ctrl-o, ctrl-i  - go through jump locations
  [I              - show lines with matching word under cursor

Vim has a so called "very magic" (/s\v) mode for regexes which allows you to
use parenthesis, brackets, the alternative separator (i.e. '|'), pluses, etc.
with their special meaning but without the need to escape those characters.

Use <C-r>{register} to insert register content to pattern

Or

Use \=@{register} to use the register in the pattern

>
  :s/search/\=@a/
<

        *Note   see :help /\v


=============================================================================
REPEAT                                                         *mydoc-repeat*

  |n| or |N|         - for searches
  |&|              - Repeat substitution
  |@@|             - Repeat macro
  |;|              - Repeat latest f, t, F or T
  |,|              - Repeat latest f, t, F or T in opposite direction
  :10,$ norm @a  - repeat macro in register a between line 10 and last line


=============================================================================
COMMANDS STARTING WITH G                     *mydoc-commands-starting-with-g*

See :help g

  |ge|        - go to previous word end

------

{0-9a-z"%#:-=.} (INSERT MODE)

Insert the contents of a numbered or named register.
Between typing 'CTRL-R' and the second character '"' will be displayed to
indicate that you are expected to enter the name of a register.

Special registers:

  0      - yank register
  1 to 9 - shifting delete registers
  a to z - registers, for your own use (capitalized A to Z are for appending
           to corresponding registers).
  _      - like /dev/null, this is a black hole
  "      - the unnamed register, containing the text of the last delete or yank
  %      - the current file name
  #      - the alternate file name
  *      - the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
  +      - the clipboard contents
  /      - the last search pattern
  :      - the last command-line
  -      - the last small (less than a line) delete
  .      - the last inserted text
  =      - the expression register: you are prompted to enter an expression
           (see |expression|) (doesn't work at the expression prompt; some things
           such as changing the buffer or current window are not allowed to avoid
           side effects) When the result is a |List| the items are used as lines.
           They can have line breaks inside too. When the result is a Float it's
           automatically converted to a String.


CTRL-R CTRL-F  the Filename under the cursor
CTRL-R CTRL-P  the Filename under the cursor, expanded with 'path' as in |gf|
CTRL-R CTRL-W  the Word under the cursor
CTRL-R CTRL-A  the WORD under the cursor; see |WORD|


See :help |registers| for the full reference.

> In Insert or Command-line mode, 'Ctrl-R plus a register name', inserts the
> contents of this register. If you want to insert them literally
> (no auto-indenting, no conversion of control characters like 0x08 to
> backspace, etc), you can use 'Ctrl-R, Ctrl-O, register name'.
> 'See :help i_CTRL-R' and following paragraphs for more reference.


> The expression register is very nice for calculating.
> 'CTRL-R =', then type '5*5' and you will get the result in the buffer.

Examples

  'Vy:@"' - Vy will select whole line and yank it into the default register
            (also known as the unnamed register). The :@ Ex command plays
            Ex commands stored in the register given as argument, and " is
            how you refer to the unnamed register.

You can inspect the current state of all registers with :registers.
See :help registers.
