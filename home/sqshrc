# .sqshrc - Example sqsh initialization file
#

# $password : Setting your password within your .sqshrc is probably
#             the most secure method of using sqsh.  However, make
#             sure that you 'chmod go-rwx ~/.sqshrc', otherwise you
#             leave yourself wide open to attacks.
#
#\set password=xxxxxxx

#
# $semicolon_hack : This turns on the ability to use a semicolon as
#             a sort of in-line go.  It is kind of hacky but seems
#             to work pretty well.
#
\set semicolon_hack=on

#
# $prompt :   The value of this variable is expanded each time the
#             prompt is displayed.  It may contain variables and
#             even command substitutions (note that $date and $time
#             are the more efficient ways of displaying the current
#             date than `date`).
#
#\set prompt='[$histnum] ${database}.${lineno}> '
#\set prompt='${lineno}> '
\set prompt='[${histnum}] ${username}@${DSQUERY}.${database}.${lineno}> '

#
# $histsize : This variable is used to configure the number of 
#             previous batches that have been executed by sqsh,
#             setting this variable high uses up a little extra
#             memory, and makes it a little harder to find the
#             query that you are looking for, but comes in handy.
#
\set histsize=1000

#\set history=.sqsh-history-${DSQUERY}-${database}
#
# $exit_failcount : This variable causes sqsh to exit with an exit
#             status of the total number of batches that failed
#             during the current session. This is useful for use 
#             within shell scripts and the such.
#
\set exit_failcount=on

#
# $keyword_completion : This variable is used to configure what sort
#             of keyword (tab) completion is performed by GNU Readline,
#             it only has an affect if readline support is compiled
#             into sqsh, otherwise it is effectively ignored.
#
\set keyword_completion=smart

#
# $history_shorthand : Turns on the ability to perform csh-style
#             history recall on the command line, such as !20.
#
\set history_shorthand=on

#
# $filter_prog : When sqsh is run with -t, or -t is passed to \go,
#             the following program will be used to filter the
#             command batch prior to being shipped off to SQL
#             server. Note, that this settings looks for a set of
#             m4 macros in $HOME/.sqsh_m4.
#
#             For you cpp fans, since cpp doesn't support the 
#             inclusion of a header file on the command line,
#             like m4, you can try something like:
#
#             \set filter_prog="cat $HOME/.sqsh_cpp - | cpp -C -P"
#
#             Assuming that your version of cpp can read from stdin.
#
\set filter_prog="m4 $HOME/.sqsh_m4 -"

#
# The following alias is used to act as a replacement for the
# '\go | more' command. It is smart enough to carry over any
# parameters to \go.  If you always want "more" support then
# you can do "\alias \go='\go !* | more'".
# 
\alias mo='\go !* | less'

#
# The following alias's create a more 'isql-like' environment.
#
\alias :r='\buf-load -a !*'
