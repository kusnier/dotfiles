Ctrl-O:  Another really useful trick is switching to normal mode for a single command. You can do this with Ctrl-O. For instance, say you¿re typing away and you want to quickly save your work, you can type Ctrl-O :w, which will write the file and put you back in insert mode.

Ctrl-U:  delete the current line from the cursor position.
Ctrl-A:  re-insert the text inserted in the previous insert session.
